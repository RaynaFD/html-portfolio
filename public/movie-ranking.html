    <h2> In no Particular order...</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Some Like It Hot</h3>
    <p>You'll rent it for Marylin and end up rewatching over and over again for Curtis and Lemmon.</p>
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>The Anime that steered my child self towards drawing and art. Delightfully creative and at times super serious. Not an animated movie for kids.</p>
<h3>Come And See</h3>
<p> Everyone should watch this anti-war film at least once in their lives.</p>
<h3>Oldboy</h3>
<p> Only the Korean version of this film. The american one doesn't exist. Best revenge flick of all time.</p>
<h3>Women Talking</h3>
<p> I cried start to finish. 10/10</p>
<h3>UHF</h3>
<p> Wierd Al, need I say more?</p>
